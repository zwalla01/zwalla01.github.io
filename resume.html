	research for the business, and preparing reports.</ol></p>
	<p>Bioinformatics Assistant within UC San Diego Health, 2017
	<ol>Throughout this summer research internship, I was a Bioinformatics assistant
	and researcher for Dr. Roman Sasik within the Center for Computation Biology
	and Bioinformatics at UC San Diego Health.  Throughout this entire internship
	I participated in a field within Bioinformatics known as Protein-Protien Interaction
	Network Analysis. The  21st century now provides us with an abundance of biological
	data that simply lists which proteins interact with other proteins in a human cell.
	These interactions among proteins can be modeled as a graph network and require
	algorithms from Graph Theory and Linear Algebra or theory from electrical physics
	and statistics to better understand how this protein network operates.  The networks
	are huge with number of interacting proteins in the thousands or tens of thousands.
	I used R Studio to store and analyze all of this data.  Dr. Sasik and I were able to
	assign statistical measures to each protein as well as clusters of proteins to identify
	which proteins and groups of proteins were very interactive with respect to the entire
	network. Aside from statistical analysis, this internship made me really good at using
	R Studio, collecting and cleaning large sets of data, improved my presintation skills 
	through weekly department presintations, and made me a lot better at thinking and
	analyizing critically.  There will be a paper published about the work Dr. Sasik
	and I accomplished sometime within the next year.</ol></p>
