There are 3 html files for this assignment: index.html, resume.html, bio.html, style.css.
The file index.html produces the content of the home page.  The file resume.html
produces all of the content for my resume page.  The file bio.html produces the content
for my bio page. The file style.css produces the design and styling for all my
webpages.

There was one aspect of this assignment that wasn't correctly implemented and it was
the fact that there were errors with my HTML files.  They did not pass the HTML5 tests
because apparently I'm not supposed to use duplicate id's for styling.  I did not know
or have time to try to fix that problem.

This assigment took me a total of about 5 hours.  Most of the time was spent figuring out
how everything works.

I did not work with anyone on this assignment.
