	<h1>About Me</h1>
	
	<p id = "bio_p">Hi, I'm Zachary Wallace, a senior at Tufts University majoring in
	applied mathematics and minoring in computer science. I'm from La Jolla
	California and grew up there all my life.</p>
	
	<p id = "bio_p">One important thing that you should know about me first is that I am a very 
	competitive swimmer for Tufts University Swimming and Diving. We compete
	in the NCAA Division 3 and are part of the New England Small College 
	Athletic Conference (NESCAC).  As a swimmer, I am a 6 time All-NESCAC team
	member (top 3 in the conference per event) and a 5 time NCAA All-American
	(top 16 nationally per event).  I am also a multi-event record holder for
	the swim team and a one-time NESCAC performer of the week.  Swimming has 
	always been extremely important to my life as well as an important aspect
	of my college career.</p>
	
	<p id = "bio_p">Aside from athletics, academically I am very passionate about math and
	computer science.  I am very fascinated by the overlap between math and 
	computer science and ways that overlap can be used to analyze and interpret
	extremely large sets of data. All in all, I'm very curious and fascinated by
	the field big-data, and am especially interested in the analysis of large sets
	of medical data, which is why I am also really interested in Bioinformatics.</p>
	
	<p id = "bio_p">I also have a lot of hobbies.  Having grown up in La Jolla, I absolutley
	love the ocean and everything about it.  I love to fish off our Riviera fishing
	boat with my dad, scuba dive, spear fish, surf, and compete in surf lifesaving 
	competitions. I am also extremely passionate about comic books and other associated
	popular arts like Marvel and DC television shows and movies.  I consider myself
	an avid comic book reader and collector and have attended the San Diego Comic Con
	over the past few years.</p>
